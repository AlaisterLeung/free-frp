# Introduction

## What is Free FRP?

You can create a fast reverse proxy \(FRP\) without hosting the proxy server to expose a local server behind a NAT or firewall to the internet. Don't know what FRP is? Learn more [here](https://github.com/fatedier/frp).

### How does it work?

To create a fast reverse proxy, you need a client \(FRPC\) and a server \(FRPS\). However, most people find it difficult to host an FRP server. Luckily, I am here to help you. The proxy server is hosted on my machine, so you only need to install the client on your local server and connect it to my proxy. Learn more about how to get started [here](getting-started.md).
