# FAQ

## Is my data secure?

Yes. I will **NEVER** collect any data sent through the proxy, but the connection details such as your FRP client's IP address and the port numbers used may be logged.

## Is this service always free?

Yes. This service won't ever cost you money.

## Why does my FRP client fail to start?

This might be caused by the following reasons:

* the port number is not allowed or has already been used by another user
* the protocol is incorrect or not supported
* something wrong with your frpc.ini file \(check any error messages\)
* the **server\_addr** or **server\_port** is incorrect \(double-check the configuration [here](getting-started.md#configuration)\)

## Still have questions?

Please send me an email at [contact@alaister.net](mailto:contact@alaister.net). I will reply to you as soon as possible.
