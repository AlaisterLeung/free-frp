# FAQ

## Is my data secure?

Yes. I **DON'T** collect the data sent through the proxy, but the port number of the connection is logged.

## Is this service always free?

Yes. This service won't ever cost you money.

## Why does my proxy fail to start?

This might be caused by the following reasons:

* the port number is already in use
* something wrong with your frpc.ini file
* the local IP address or local port number is incorrect
* your local server firewall blocks the connection
* our server is offline or under maintenance
* the IP address or port number of our proxy server has been changed

## How can I check which port is available?

An API will be released soon. You may try using some weird port numbers, like 49283, or any strange numbers you like.

## Still have questions?

Please send me an email at [contact@alaister.net](mailto:contact@alaister.net). I will reply to you as soon as possible.
